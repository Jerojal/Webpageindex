    <h1>Asian Animals </h1>
	<ul>
	<li><p style="padding: 20px; font-size: 20px;">	Asia is the world’s most populous and biggest continent in the Northern and Eastern hemispheres, 
	with the world’s longest coastline and the highest and lowest points on the Earth’s surface.It has a mostly dry climate throughout, the biggest weather extremes in the west, and monsoons affecting the south and east. Habitats range from deserts, mountains, forests, and tropical jungles to urban areas. 
	Such a vast and varied landscape with several remote regions mean Asian wildlife is just as diverse.</p></li>

		<h2> Endemic Animals </h2>
	<p>Among the endemic animal species - species that can only be found in Australia - are the monotremes, which are mammals that lay eggs! The platypus and two species of echidna are the world's only egg-laying mammals, so called monotremes. 
Australia has almost 400 mammal species and about 140 species of marsupials. A marsupial is an animal that carries the young in her pouch.
Half of the birds that live in Australia, can only be found there. Among the typical Australian bird species are the kookaburra, the emu and the rainbow lorikeet, an especially colourful parrot which has a red beak and a multicolour plumage.
	</p>
	<h2> Cassowary</h2>
	<p>The cassowary is the heaviest flightless bird in Australia. A cassowary has black feathers on the body, but the neck and face is colourful. Cassowaries have a very low frequency call which almost cannot be heard by humans. 
	The cassowary has a casque, a sponge-like helmet which is covered with keratin. Keratin is the material our fingernails are made of. 
	The cassowary is the most dangerous bird in the world as it has the most powerful kick. The foot has three toes with a dagger-like claw. The cassowary can run and swim very fast, so it easily can escape any dangerous situations. ajfajspfjapfjwjgiowgiwerioeiorhbioejmrhioesrhjmeriohjmbeiorjhiejmrhriomeoirhjmioerhioejmrhiojmeroiheiorhjmoierhoierihojeiorhjeirjhioejrhioerhiojeiorhjieojr

		<h2> Dingo </h2>
	<p>The dingo is legendary as Australia's wild dog, though it also occurs in Southeast Asia. 
	The Australian animals may be descendents of Asian dingoes that were introduced to the continent some 3,000 to 4,000 years ago.
	</p>
	<h2> Behavior and Diet</h2>
<p>These golden or reddish-colored canids may live alone (especially young males) or in packs of up to ten animals. 
They roam great distances and communicate with wolf-like howls.
Dingo hunting is opportunistic. Animals hunt alone or in cooperative packs. 
They pursue small game such as rabbits, rodents, birds, and lizards. These dogs will eat fruits and plants as well. They also scavenge from humans, particularly in their Asian range.
Dingoes breed only once a year. Females typically give birth to about five pups, which are not independent until six to eight months of age. 
In packs, a dominant breeding female will kill the offspring of other females.
